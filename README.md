### Hello!


### A note on simplicity
I like to keep things as simple as possible. Simple things are easy to understand, easy to change/update, harder to make mistakes, quick to make and only focus on the important things.
When you write code that is simple and short, you reduce technical debt.

KISS Keep It Simple Stupid.
It is easy to make complex things and hard to make simple things.

You can see this mindset in code:
-code is focussed on readability (clear names, structure)
-code is short (little/no boilerplate code)
-code does not use many libraries or compiler settings
